The Library Management System is designed to assist the FunReadings Library staff in managing the library's vast array of resources. Each item in the library—be it a book, journal, or media item—is uniquely identified and cataloged with specific attributes such as ID, name, author(s), and publication year. Books are further described by the number of pages, journals by volume number, and media by type (audio, video, or interactive), with items categorized using unique ID prefixes for easy identification (Books: B, Journals: J, Media: M).

The system will provide a robust user interface allowing staff to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, or updating item information, listing items by category, and managing complete client profiles including lease and return transactions. Key features include the ability to track all items leased to a client, display the largest book in the collection, and manage data integrity through deep copying of item arrays.

<b>Technical Specifications:</b>

  - Class Hierarchy: Utilize Java inheritance to structure classes representing different types of library items and clients.
  - Package Structure: Organized into three Java packages to separate the main driver class, client management, and item management functionalities.
  - Constructors and Methods: Implementation of default, parameterized, and copy constructors for all classes, alongside essential methods like toString(), equals(), and various accessors and mutators to facilitate object manipulation.
  - Access Rights: Strategic use of Java's access modifiers to balance usability and information hiding, ensuring that attributes are accessed and modified in a controlled manner.
